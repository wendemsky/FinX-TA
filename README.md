# FinX-TA-Project-Files

This project is for my FinX Technical Assessment


The two API's I have used are 7Timer! API and Place holder API.
I have tried to implement pagination on the second page.

This is the home page, having descriptions of the API's used

This is the first page, using the 7Timer! Api

This is the second page, using the Place holder Api, I have tried implementing pagination but I am facing an issue with exporting a state, I think it can be solved
using the useContext hook or the Redux store.

This is the home page when you want to use the sidebar

It was a fun challenge, I learnt about pagination and a bunch or other topics.
